			<h1>A Guide To Coffee</h1>
			<p>66% of adults in America drink coffee every day. But for how common coffee is it's just as
				complex.
				There are
				129 different species in genus Coffea, tens of thousands of different varieties,
				differnt
				roasting and
				processing methods, many different brew methods, and somehow even more drinks ranging
				from a
				plain black
				coffee to the Unicorn Frappucino. This guide will not cover all the complexities of
				coffee, not even close, but it will scratch the surface of species.

			<h2>Species</h2>
			<img src="assets/coffea_arabica.jpg" alt="Cofea Arabica">
			<p>While there are 129 different species of Coffea the majority of species are unfit for
				commercial
				production.
				Only 4 species are commercially produced: Arabic, Robusta, Excelsa, and Liberica. Of
				those 4
				Arabic and
				Robusta make up roughly 95% of coffee production.</p>
			<h3>Arabica</h3>
			<p>Arabica is the most common species produced and sold around the world. Arabica prefers to
				grow at
				high
				altitudes, in shaded areas and int subtropical areas. Arabica contains roughly 1.2%
				caffeine and
				is
				known to have a sweeter, fruitier, more floral flavor profile when compared to Robusta.
			</p>
			<h3>Robusta</h3>
			<p>Robusta is the second most common species of Coffea. Robusta prefers to grow at lower
				altitudes
				compared to
				Arabica and can tolerate direct sun and dryer conditions. Robusta contains roughly 2.2%
				caffeine
				and has
				more earthy, chocolately and bold flavors when compared to Arabica. Fun fact: since
				Robusta is
				more
				robust in what growing conditions it can tolerate it has lead to Robusta being grown
				more often
				in
				poorer conditions. Poorly grown Robusta coffee entering the market has created the
				misconsception that
				Robusta as a species is of a lower quality than Arabica.</p>
